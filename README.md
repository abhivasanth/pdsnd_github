### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user in this manner: Script should prompt the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data, display that data if the answer is 'yes', and continue these prompts and displays until the user says 'no'.

Known design : Ability for user to enter number of lines of raw data only once. If invalid input entered. Default value is set to 5 and 5 lines of raw data is viewable per every request(everytime the user is prompted to view the data).Packages likes time, pandas and numpy are imported for this project.

### Files used
